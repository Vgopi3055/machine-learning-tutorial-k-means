## Introduction

This project uses K-Means clustering to analyze the Iris dataset and reduce its dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Additionally, the project applies K-Means clustering to compress an image by reducing the number of colors in it.

### Iris Dataset Clustering
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each having 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a species label. The goal of the clustering is to group the flowers into 3 clusters based on these features.

### Image Compression
In this example, an image is compressed by reducing its color palette using K-Means clustering. The image is represented with fewer colors to reduce its size while maintaining visual similarity to the original.
